This is the complete reference of the various fields and classes that a user of ReFrame may need when writing a regression test.

# `Environment` class

| Field name | Description | Default value | Type | Version |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---- |---------|
| `name`     | Name of the environment. | Read-only* | non-whitespace string | 2.2 |


# `Job` class

| Field name | Description | Default value | Type | Version |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---- | ------- |
| `launcher` | The job launcher associated to this job descriptor, e.g., "srun", "mpirun" etc. | Read-only* | `JobLauncher` | 2.2 |
| `post_run` | List of shell commands to emit after the actual job launch. | `[]` | list of strings | 2.2 |
| `pre_run`  | List of shell commands to emit before the actual job launch. | `[]` | list of strings | 2.2 |

# `JobLauncher` class

| Field name | Description | Default value | Type | Version |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---- | ------- |
| `options`  | List of options to be passed to this job launcher. | `[]` | list of strings | 2.2 |

The only `JobLauncher` that users may use is the `LauncherWrapper`, which wraps an existing launcher by prepending a user program to its invocation.
This is useful for parallel debuggers.

```python
LauncherWrapper(launcher, wrapper_cmd, wrapper_options)
```

| Argument | Description | Type | Version |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- | ------- |
| `launcher` | The existing launcher to wrap. | `JobLauncher` | 2.2 |
| `wrapper_cmd` | The wrapping command. | string | 2.2 |
| `wrapper_options` | List of options to pass to the wrapping command. | list of strings | 2.2 |

Example usage below:

```python
def setup(self, system, environ, **job_opts):
    super().setup(system, environ, **job_opts)
    self.job.launcher = LauncherWrapper(self.job.launcher, 'ddt', [ '--offline' ])
```


# `ProgEnvironment` class

Fields additional to those defined by [Environment](#environment-class):

| Field name | Description | Default value | Type | Version |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---- | ------- |
| `cc`       | The C compiler used by this environment. | `cc` | string | 2.2 |
| `cxx`      | The C++ compiler used by this environment. | `CC` | string | 2.2 |
| `ftn`      | The Fortran compiler used by this environment. | `ftn` | string | 2.2 |
| `cppflags` | Preprocessor flags. | `None` | string | 2.2 |
| `cflags`   | The C compiler flags. | `None` | string | 2.2 |
| `cxxflags` | The C++ compiler flags. | `None` | string | 2.2 |
| `fflags`   | The Fortran compiler flags. | `None` | string | 2.2 |
| `ldflags`  | Linker flags. | `None` | string | 2.2 |
| `propagate` | Propagate the compilation flags to the `make` invocation | `True` | boolean | 2.3 |

The correct compiler is picked by examining the source file extensions based on GCC's recognition [patterns](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Overall-Options.html).
Additionally, source files with the `.cu` extension are recognized as CUDA source files and are compiled with `nvcc`.

The generated compilation command has the following pattern (example for C, but other languages are treated the same way):
```
cc $cppflags $cflags -I<srcdir> <srcfile> -o <executable> $ldflags
```
* Notice that `cppflags` are passed to all languages.

In case that a whole directory is compiled and `propagate` is `True`, the generated command is the following:
```
make -C <srcdir> -f <makefile> CC=$cc CXX=$cxx FC=$ftn \
    CPPFLAGS=$cppflags CFLAGS=$cflags CXXFLAGS=$cxxflags FFLAGS=$fflags LDFLAGS=$ldflags
```
If `propagate` is set to `False`, no flags will be passed to `make`.

> NOTE: From version 2.3 onward all the compilation flags default to `None` instead of the empty string.
> This has no difference to the previous versions when you compile a single file, but the behavior changes in case a directory is compiled and `make` is invoked.
> In this case, if a flag variable is set to `None`, it will not be passed over to the `make` invocation.
> Note that if a flag variable is set explicitly to the empty string, it **will** be passed to the `make` invocation.

| `maintainers` | List of people responsible for this test. When the test fails, this contact list will be printed out. | `[]` | list of strings | 2.2 |
| `modules` | List of modules to be loaded before running this test. These modules will be loaded during the test's setup phase. | `[]` | list of strings | 2.2 |
| `name`     | The name of the test | N/A | alphanumeric | 2.2 |

| `sanity_patterns` | The set of sanity patterns to look for for this test. | `None` | See [Output parsing](#output-parsing-and-performance-assessment) | 2.2 |
| `sourcepath` | The path to the source file or source directory of the test. If not absolute, it is resolved against the `sourcesdir` directory. If it refers to a regular file, this file will be compiled (its language will be automatically recognized) and the produced executable will be placed in the test's stage directory. If it refers to a directory, this will be copied to the test's stage directory and `make` will be invoked in that. | `''` | string | 2.2 |
| `sourcesdir` | The directory containing the test's resources. In a `RunOnlyRegressionTest`, you can set this field to `None` if you do not need any resources at all. | `<test-prefix>/src/` | string | 2.2 |
| `stagedir` | The stage directory of the test. This is set during the test's setup phase. | Read-only* | string | 2.2 |
| `stderr` | The name of the file containing the standard error of the test. This is set during the test's setup phase. | Read-only* | string | 2.2 |
| `stdout` | The name of the file containing the standard output of the test. This is set during the test's setup phase. | Read-only* | string | 2.2 |
| `strict_check` | Specify whether this test allows a relaxed performance interpretation through the `--relax-performance-check` command-line option. If set to `False` and the aforementioned option is specified, the result of the performance checking phase will always be success. Note that the performance check is not skipped; it is just its result that is ignored. If set to `True`, the performance check for this test cannot be relaxed. |  `True` | boolean | 2.2 |
| `tags` | Set of tags to be associated with this regression test. This regression test can be selected from the frontend using any of these tags. | `{}` | set of strings | 2.2 |

| `valid_prog_environs` | Programming environmets supported by this test. | `[]` | list of strings | 2.2 |
| `valid_systems` | Systems supported by this test. The general syntax for systems is `<sysname>[:<partname]`. | `[]` | list of strings | 2.2 |
| `variables` | Environment variables to be set before running this test. These variables will be set during the test's setup phase. | `{}` | dictionary of string/string pairs | 2.2 |

> NOTES:
>   * From version 2.4 onwards, the `variables` field of `RegressionTest` may accept other environment variables as values using standard shell syntax, e.g., `$VARNAME` or `${VARNAME}`. Also the variables are now set after the environment modules in `modules` field are loaded.
>   * From version 2.4 onwards, the `use_multithreading` field defaults to `None` instead of `False`.
>     If not set, no hint will be emitted for the Slurm scheduler.
>   * From version 2.5 onwards, it is possible to set set `sourcesdir` to `None` in a `RunOnlyRegressionTest` if no resources are needed at all (before an empty `src/` directory was required even for tests without any resources).
