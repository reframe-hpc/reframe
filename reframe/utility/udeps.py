'''Managing the test case "micro-dependencies" between two tests.

This module defines a set of basic functions that can be used with the ``how``
argument of the :func:`reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.depends_on`
function to control how the individual dependencies between the test cases of
two tests are formed.

All functions take two arguments, the source and destination vertices of an
edge in the test case dependency subgraph that connects two tests. In the
relation *"T0 depends on T1"*, the source are the test cases of "T0" and the
destination are the test cases of "T1." The source and destination arguments
are two-element tuples containing the names of the partition and the
environment of the corresponding test cases. These functions return
:class:`True` if there is an edge connecting the two test cases or
:class:`False` otherwise.

A ``how`` function will be called by the framework multiple times when the
test DAG is built. More specifically, for each test dependency relation, it
will be called once for each test case combination of the two tests.

The ``how`` functions essentially split the test case subgraph of two
dependent tests into fully connected components based on the values of their
supported partitions and environments.

The :doc:`dependencies` page contains more information about test dependencies
and shows visually the test case subgraph connectivity that the different
``how`` functions described here achieve.
