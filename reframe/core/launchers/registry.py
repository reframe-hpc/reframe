    This method may become handy in very special situations, e.g., testing an
    application that needs to replace the system partition launcher or if a
    different launcher must be used for a different programming environment.

    For example, if you want to replace the current partition's launcher with
    the local one, here is how you can achieve it:

    ::

        def setup(self, partition, environ, **job_opts):
            super().setup(partition, environ, **job_opts)
            self.job.launcher = getlauncher('local')()


    Note that this method returns a launcher class type and not an instance of
    that class.
    You have to instantiate it explicitly before assigning it to the
    :attr:`launcher` attribute of the job.

    .. note::
       .. versionadded:: 2.8

    :arg name: The name of the launcher to retrieve.
    :returns: The class of the launcher requested, which is a subclass of
        :class:`reframe.core.launchers.JobLauncher`.
    :raises reframe.core.exceptions.ConfigError: if no launcher is
        registered with that name.
