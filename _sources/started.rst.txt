Getting Started
===============

Requirements
------------

-  Python 3.5 or higher. Python 2 is not supported.
-  A functional Tcl `modules <http://modules.sourceforge.net/>`__ software management environment with Python bindings. The following need to be present or functional:

   -  ``MODULESHOME`` variable must be set.
   -  ``modulecmd python`` must be supported.

Optional
~~~~~~~~

-  The `nose <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose>`__ Python module must be installed if you want to run the unit tests of the framework.
-  If you want to use the framework for launching tests on a cluster, a functional job submission management system is required. Currently only `Slurm <https://www.schedmd.com/>`__ is supported with either a native Slurm job launcher or the Cray ALPS launcher.

   -  In the case of Slurm, job accounting storage (``sacct`` command) is required.

You are advised to run the `unit tests <#running-the-unit-tests>`__ of the framework after installing it on a new system to make sure that everything works fine.

Getting the Framework
---------------------

To get the latest stable version of the framework, you can just clone it from the `github <https://github.com/eth-cscs/reframe>`__ project page:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/eth-cscs/reframe.git

Alternatively, you can pick a previous stable version by downloading it from the previous `releases <https://github.com/eth-cscs/reframe/releases>`__ section.

Running the Unit Tests
----------------------

After you have downloaded the framework, it is important to run the unit tests of to make sure that everything is set up correctly:

.. code:: bash

    ./test_reframe.py -v

The output should look like the following:

.. code:: bash

    test_check_failure (unittests.test_cli.TestFrontend) ... ok
    test_check_sanity_failure (unittests.test_cli.TestFrontend) ... ok
    test_check_submit_success (unittests.test_cli.TestFrontend) ... SKIP: job submission not supported
    test_check_success (unittests.test_cli.TestFrontend) ... ok
    test_checkpath_recursion (unittests.test_cli.TestFrontend) ... ok
    test_custom_performance_check_failure (unittests.test_cli.TestFrontend) ... ok
    ...
    test_copytree (unittests.test_utility.TestOSTools) ... ok
    test_grep (unittests.test_utility.TestOSTools) ... ok
    test_inpath (unittests.test_utility.TestOSTools) ... ok
    test_subdirs (unittests.test_utility.TestOSTools) ... ok
    test_always_true (unittests.test_utility.TestUtilityFunctions) ... ok
    test_standard_threshold (unittests.test_utility.TestUtilityFunctions) ... ok

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 235 tests in 33.842s

    OK (SKIP=7)

You will notice in the output that all the job submission related tests have been skipped. The test suite detects if the current system has a job submission system and is configured for ReFrame (see `Configuring ReFrame for your site <configure.html>`__) and it will skip all the unsupported unit tests. As soon as you configure ReFrame for your system, you can rerun the test suite to check that job submission unit tests pass as well. Note here that some unit tests may still be skipped depending on the configured job submission system. For example, the Slurm+ALPS tests will also be skipped on a system configured with native SLURM.

Where to Go from Here
---------------------

The next step from here is to setup and configure ReFrame for your site, so that ReFrame can automatically recognize it and submit jobs. Please refer to the `"Configuring Reframe For Your Site" <configure.html>`__ section on how to do that.

Before starting implementing a regression test, you should go through the `"The Regression Test Pipeline" <pipeline.html>`__ section, so as to understand the mechanism that ReFrame uses to run the regression tests. This section will let you follow easily the `"ReFrame Tutorial" <tutorial.html>`__ as well as understand the more advanced examples in the `"Customizing Further A Regression Test" <advanced.html>`__ section.

To learn how to invoke the ReFrame command-line interface for running your tests, please refer to the `"Running ReFrame" <running.html>`__ section.
