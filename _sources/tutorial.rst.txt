ReFrame Tutorial
================

This tutorial will guide you through writing your first regression tests with ReFrame. We will start with the most common and simple case of a regression test that compiles a code, runs it and checks its output. We will then expand this example gradually by adding functionality and more advanced sanity and performance checks. By the end of the tutorial, you should be able to start writing your first regression tests with ReFrame.

If you just want to get a quick feeling of how it is like writing a regression test in ReFrame, you can start directly from here. However, if you want to get a better understanding of what is happening behind the scenes, we recommend to have a look also in `"The Regression Test Pipeline" <pipeline.html>`__ section.

All the tutorial examples can be found in ``<reframe-install-prefix>/tutorial/``.

For the configuration of the system, we provide a minimal configuration file for Piz Daint, where we have tested all the tutorial examples. The site configuration that we used for this tutorial is the following:

You can find the full ``settings.py`` file ready to be used by ReFrame in ``<reframe-install-prefix>/tutorial/config/settings.py``. You may first need to go over the `"Configuring ReFrame For Your Site" <configure.html>`__ section, in order to prepare the framework for your systems.

The First Regression Test
-------------------------

The following is a simple regression test that compiles and runs a serial C program, which computes a matrix-vector product (``tutorial/src/example_matrix_multiplication.c``), and verifies its sane execution. As a sanity check, it simply looks for a specific output in the output of the program. Here is the full code for this test:

.. code:: python

    import os
    import reframe.utility.sanity as sn

    from reframe.core.pipeline import RegressionTest


    class SerialTest(RegressionTest):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__('example1_check',
                             os.path.dirname(__file__), **kwargs)
            self.descr = 'Simple matrix-vector multiplication example'
            self.valid_systems = ['*']
            self.valid_prog_environs = ['*']
            self.sourcepath = 'example_matrix_vector_multiplication.c'
            self.executable_opts = ['1024', '100']
            self.sanity_patterns = sn.assert_found(
                r'time for single matrix vector multiplication', self.stdout)
            self.maintainers = ['you-can-type-your-email-here']
            self.tags = {'tutorial'}


    def _get_checks(**kwargs):
        return [SerialTest(**kwargs)]

A regression test written in ReFrame is essentially a Python class that must eventually derive from ``reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest``. In order to make the test available to the framework, every file defining regression tests must define the special function ``_get_checks()``, which it should return a list of instantiated regression tests. This method will be called by the framework upon loading your file, in order to retrieve the regression tests defined. The framework will pass some special arguments to the ``_get_checks()`` function through the ``kwargs`` parameter, which are needed for the correct initialization of the regression test.

Now let's move on to the actual definition of the ``SerialTest`` here:

.. code:: python

    class SerialTest(RegressionTest):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__('example1_check', os.path.dirname(__file__), **kwargs)

The ``__init__()`` method is the constructor of your test. It is usually the only method you need to implement for your tests, especially if you don't want to customize any of the regression test pipeline stages. The first statement in the ``SerialTest`` constructor calls the constructor of the base class, passing it as arguments the name of the regression test (``example1_check`` here), the prefix of the test (the directory that the regression test file resides) and any other arguments passed to the ``SerialTest``'s constructor. You can consider these first three lines and especially the way you should call the constructor of the base class, as boilerplate code. As you will see, it remains the same across all our examples, except, of course, for the check name.

The next line sets a more detailed description of the test:

.. code:: python

            self.descr = 'Simple matrix-vector multiplication example'

This is optional and it defaults to the regression test's name, if not specified.

The next two lines specify the systems and the programming environments that this test is valid for:

.. code:: python

            self.valid_systems = ['*']
            self.valid_prog_environs = ['*']

Both of these variables accept a list of system names or environment names, respectively. The ``*`` symbol is a wildcard meaning any system or any programming environment. The system and environment names listed in these variables must correspond to names of systems and environments defined in the ReFrame's `settings file <configure.html#the-configuration-file>`__.

    NOTE: If a name specified in these lists does not appear in the settings file, it will be simply ignored.

When specifying system names you can always specify a partition name as well by appending ``:<partname>`` to the system's name. For example, given the configuration for our tutorial, ``daint:gpu`` would refer specifically to the ``gpu`` virtual partition of the system ``daint``. If only a system name (without a partition) is specified in the ``self.valid_systems`` variable, e.g., ``daint``, it means that this test is valid for any partition of this system.

The next line specifies the source file that needs to be compiled:

.. code:: python

            self.sourcepath = 'example_matrix_vector_multiplication.c'

ReFrame expects any source files, or generally resources, of the test to be inside an ``src/`` directory, which is at the same level as the regression test file. If you inspect the directory structure of the ``tutorial/`` folder, you will notice that:

::

    tutorial/
        example1.py
        src/
            example_matrix_vector_multiplication.c

Notice also that you need not specify the programming language of the file you are asking ReFrame to compile or the compiler to use. ReFrame will automatically pick the correct compiler based on the extension of the source file. The exact compiler that is going to be used depends on the programming environment that the test is running with. For example, given our configuration, if it is run with ``PrgEnv-cray``, the Cray C compiler will be used, if it is run with ``PrgEnv-gnu``, the GCC compiler will be used etc. A user can associate compilers with programming environments in the ReFrame's `settings file <configure.html#the-configuration-file>`__.

The next line in our first regression test specifies a list of options to be used for running the generated executable:

.. code:: python

            self.executable_opts = ['1024', '100']

Notice that you do not need to specify the executable name. Since ReFrame compiled it and generated it, it knows the name. We will see in the `"Customizing Further A ReFrame Regression Test" <advanced.html>`__ section, how you can specify the name of the executable, in cases that ReFrame cannot guess its name.

The next lines specify what should be checked for assessing the sanity of the result of the test:

.. code:: python

            self.sanity_patterns = sn.assert_found(
                r'time for single matrix vector multiplication', self.stdout)

This expression simply asks ReFrame to look for ``time for single matrix vector multiplication`` in the standard output of the test. The ``sanity_patterns`` attribute can only be assigned the result of a special type of functions, called *sanity functions*. `Sanity functions <deferrables.html>`__ are special in the sense that they are evaluated lazily. You can generally treat them as normal Python functions inside a ``sanity_patterns`` expression. ReFrame provides already a wide range of useful sanity functions ranging from wrappers to the standard built-in functions of Python to functions related to parsing the output of a regression test. For a complete listing of the available functions, please have a look at the `"Sanity Functions Reference" <sanity_functions_reference.html>`__.

In our example, the ``assert_found()`` function accepts a regular expression pattern to be searched in a file and either returns ``True`` on success or raises a ``reframe.core.exceptions.SanityError`` in case of failure with a descriptive message. This function uses internally the "`re <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/re.html>`__" module of the Python standard library, so it may accept the same `regular expression syntax <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__. As a file argument, ``assert_found()`` accepts any filename, which will be resolved against the stage directory of the test. You can also use the ``self.stdout`` and ``self.stderr`` attributes to reference the standard output and standard error, respectively.

    NOTE: You need not to care about handling exceptions, and error handling in general, inside your test. The framework will automatically abort the execution of the test, report the error and continue with the next test case.

The last two lines of the regression test are optional, but serve a good role in a production environment:

.. code:: python

            self.maintainers = ['you-can-type-your-email-here']
            self.tags = {'tutorial'}

In the ``maintainers`` attribute you may store a list of people responsible for the maintenance of this test. In case of failure, this list will be printed in the failure summary.

The ``tags`` attribute is a set of tags that you can assign to this test. This is useful for categorizing the tests and helps in quickly selecting the tests of interest. More about test selection, you can find in the `"Running ReFrame" <running.html>`__ section.

    NOTE: The values assigned to the attributes of a ``RegressionTest`` are validated and if they don't have the correct type, an error will be issued by ReFrame. For a list of all the attributes and their types, please refer to the `"Reference Guide" <reference.html>`__.

Running the Tutorial Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ReFrame offers a rich command-line interface that allows you to control several aspects of its executions. A more detailed description can be found in the `"Running ReFrame" <running.html>`__ section. Here we will only show you how to run a specific tutorial test:

::

    ./bin/reframe -c tutorial/ -n example1_check -r

If everything is configured correctly for your system, you should get an output similar to the following:

Notice how our regression test is run on every partition of the configured system and for every programming environment.

Now that you have got a first understanding of how a regression test is written in ReFrame, let's try to expand our example.

Customizing the Compilation Phase
---------------------------------

In this example, we write a regression test to compile and run the OpenMP version of the matrix-vector product program, that we have shown before. The full code of this test follows:

.. code:: python

    import os
    import reframe.utility.sanity as sn

    from reframe.core.pipeline import RegressionTest


    class OpenMPTestIfElse(RegressionTest):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__('example2a_check',
                             os.path.dirname(__file__), **kwargs)
            self.descr = 'Matrix-vector multiplication example with OpenMP'
            self.valid_systems = ['*']
            self.valid_prog_environs = ['PrgEnv-cray', 'PrgEnv-gnu',
                                        'PrgEnv-intel', 'PrgEnv-pgi']
            self.sourcepath = 'example_matrix_vector_multiplication_openmp.c'
            self.executable_opts = ['1024', '100']
            self.variables = {
                'OMP_NUM_THREADS': '4'
            }
            self.sanity_patterns = sn.assert_found(
                r'time for single matrix vector multiplication', self.stdout)
            self.maintainers = ['you-can-type-your-email-here']
            self.tags = {'tutorial'}

        def compile(self):
            env_name = self.current_environ.name
            if env_name == 'PrgEnv-cray':
                self.current_environ.cflags = '-homp'
            elif env_name == 'PrgEnv-gnu':
                self.current_environ.cflags = '-fopenmp'
            elif env_name == 'PrgEnv-intel':
                self.current_environ.cflags = '-openmp'
            elif env_name == 'PrgEnv-pgi':
                self.current_environ.cflags = '-mp'

            super().compile()


    def _get_checks(**kwargs):
        return [OpenMPTestIfElse(**kwargs)]

There are two new things introduced with this example:

1. We need to set the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` environment variable, in order to specify the number of threads to use with our program.
2. We need to specify different flags for the different compilers provided by the programming environments we are testing. Notice also that we now restrict the validity of our test only to the programming environments that we know how to handle (see the ``self.valid_prog_environs``).

To define environment variables to be set during the execution of a test, you should use the ``variables`` attribute of the ``RegressionTest`` class. This is a dictionary, whose keys are the names of the environment variables and whose values are the values of the environment variables. Notice that both the keys and the values must be strings.

In order to set the compiler flags for the current programming environment, you have to override either the ``setup()`` or the ``compile()`` method of the ``RegressionTest``. As described in `"The Regression Test Pipeline" <pipeline.html>`__ section, it is during the setup phase that a regression test is prepared for a new system partition and a new programming environment. Here we choose to override the ``compile()`` method, since setting compiler flags is simply more relevant to this phase conceptually.

    NOTE: The ``RegressionTest`` implements the six phases of the regression test pipeline in separate methods. Individual regression tests may override them to provide alternative implementations, but in all practical cases, only the ``setup()`` and the ``compile()`` methods may need to be overriden. You will hardly ever need to override any of the other methods and, in fact, you should be very careful when doing it.

The ``current_environ`` attribute of the ``RegressionTest`` holds an instance of the current programming environment. This variable is available to regression tests after the setup phase. Before it is ``None``, so you cannot access it safely during the initialization phase. Let's have a closer look at the ``compile()`` method:

.. code:: python

        def compile(self):
            env_name = self.current_environ.name
            if env_name == 'PrgEnv-cray':
                self.current_environ.cflags = '-homp'
            elif env_name == 'PrgEnv-gnu':
                self.current_environ.cflags = '-fopenmp'
            elif env_name == 'PrgEnv-intel':
                self.current_environ.cflags = '-openmp'
            elif env_name == 'PrgEnv-pgi':
                self.current_environ.cflags = '-mp'

            super().compile()

We first take the name of the current programming environment (``self.current_environ.name``) and we check it against the set of the known programming environments. We then set the compilation flags accordingly. Since our target file is a C program, we just set the ``cflags`` of the current programming environment. Finally, we call the ``compile()`` method of the base class, in order to perform the actual compilation.

An alternative implementation using dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we present an alternative implementation of the same test using a dictionary to hold the compilation flags for the different programming environments. The advantage of this implementation is that you move the different compilation flags in the initialization phase, where also the rest of the test's specification is, thus making it more concise.

The ``compile()`` method is now very simple: it gets the correct compilation flags from the ``prgenv_flags`` dictionary and applies them to the current programming environment.

    NOTE: A regression test is like any other Python class, so you can freely define your own attributes. If you accidentally try to write on a reserved ``RegressionTest`` attribute that is not writeable, ReFrame will prevent this and it will throw an error.

.. code:: python

    import os
    import reframe.utility.sanity as sn

    from reframe.core.pipeline import RegressionTest


    class OpenMPTestDict(RegressionTest):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__('example2b_check',
                             os.path.dirname(__file__), **kwargs)
            self.descr = 'Matrix-vector multiplication example with OpenMP'
            self.valid_systems = ['*']
            self.valid_prog_environs = ['PrgEnv-cray', 'PrgEnv-gnu',
                                        'PrgEnv-intel', 'PrgEnv-pgi']
            self.sourcepath = 'example_matrix_vector_multiplication_openmp.c'
            self.executable_opts = ['1024', '100']
            self.prgenv_flags = {
                'PrgEnv-cray':  '-homp',
                'PrgEnv-gnu':   '-fopenmp',
                'PrgEnv-intel': '-openmp',
                'PrgEnv-pgi':   '-mp'
            }
            self.variables = {
                'OMP_NUM_THREADS': '4'
            }
            self.sanity_patterns = sn.assert_found(
                r'time for single matrix vector multiplication', self.stdout)
            self.maintainers = ['you-can-type-your-email-here']
            self.tags = {'tutorial'}

        def compile(self):
            prgenv_flags = self.prgenv_flags[self.current_environ.name]
            self.current_environ.cflags = prgenv_flags
            super().compile()

        return [OpenMPTestDict(**kwargs)]

Running on Multiple Nodes
-------------------------

So far, all our tests run on a single node. Depending on the actual system that ReFrame is running, the test may run locally or be submitted to the system's job scheduler. In this example, we write a regression test for the MPI+OpenMP version of the matrix-vector product. The source code of this program is in ``tutorial/src/example_matrix_vector_multiplication_mpi_openmp.c``. The regression test file follows:

.. code:: python

    import os
    import reframe.utility.sanity as sn

    from reframe.core.pipeline import RegressionTest


    class MPITest(RegressionTest):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__('example3_check',
                             os.path.dirname(__file__), **kwargs)
            self.descr = 'Matrix-vector multiplication example with MPI'
            self.valid_systems = ['daint:gpu', 'daint:mc']
            self.valid_prog_environs = ['PrgEnv-cray', 'PrgEnv-gnu',
                                        'PrgEnv-intel', 'PrgEnv-pgi']
            self.sourcepath = 'example_matrix_vector_multiplication_mpi_openmp.c'
            self.executable_opts = ['1024', '10']
            self.prgenv_flags = {
                'PrgEnv-cray':  '-homp',
                'PrgEnv-gnu':   '-fopenmp',
                'PrgEnv-intel': '-openmp',
                'PrgEnv-pgi':   '-mp'
            }
            self.sanity_patterns = sn.assert_found(
                r'time for single matrix vector multiplication', self.stdout)
            self.num_tasks = 8
            self.num_tasks_per_node = 2
            self.num_cpus_per_task = 4
            self.variables = {
                'OMP_NUM_THREADS': str(self.num_cpus_per_task)
            }
            self.maintainers = ['you-can-type-your-email-here']
            self.tags = {'tutorial'}

        def compile(self):
            prgenv_flags = self.prgenv_flags[self.current_environ.name]
            self.current_environ.cflags = prgenv_flags
            super().compile()


    def _get_checks(**kwargs):
        return [MPITest(**kwargs)]

This test is pretty much similar to the `test example <#an-alternative-implementation-using-dictionaries>`__ for the OpenMP code we have shown before, except that it adds some information about the configuration of the distributed tasks. It also restricts the valid systems only to those that support distributed execution. Let's take the changes step-by-step:

First we need to specify for which partitions this test is meaningful by setting the ``valid_systems`` attribute:

.. code:: python

            self.valid_systems = ['daint:gpu', 'daint:mc']

We only specify the partitions that are configured with a job scheduler. If we try to run the generated executable on the login nodes, it will fail. So we remove this partition from the list of the supported systems.

The most important addition to this check are the variables controlling the distributed execution:

.. code:: python

            self.num_tasks = 8
            self.num_tasks_per_node = 2
            self.num_cpus_per_task = 4

By setting these variables, we specify that this test should run with 8 MPI tasks in total, using two tasks per node. Each task may use four logical CPUs. Based on these variables ReFrame will generate the appropriate scheduler flags to meet that requirement. For example, for Slurm these variables will result in the following flags: ``--ntasks=8``, ``--ntasks-per-node=2`` and ``--cpus-per-task=4``. ReFrame provides several more variables for configuring the job submission. As shown in the following Table, they follow closely the corresponding Slurm options. For schedulers that do not provide the same functionality, some of the variables may be ignored.

Testing a GPU Code
------------------

In this example, we will create two regression tests for two different GPU versions of our matrix-vector code: OpenACC and CUDA. Let's start with the OpenACC regression test:

.. code:: python

    import os
    import reframe.utility.sanity as sn

    from reframe.core.pipeline import RegressionTest


    class OpenACCTest(RegressionTest):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__('example4_check',
                             os.path.dirname(__file__), **kwargs)
            self.descr = 'Matrix-vector multiplication example with OpenACC'
            self.valid_systems = ['daint:gpu']
            self.valid_prog_environs = ['PrgEnv-cray', 'PrgEnv-pgi']
            self.sourcepath = 'example_matrix_vector_multiplication_openacc.c'
            self.executable_opts = ['1024', '100']
            self.modules = ['craype-accel-nvidia60']
            self.num_gpus_per_node = 1
            self.prgenv_flags = {
                'PrgEnv-cray': '-hacc -hnoomp',
                'PrgEnv-pgi':  '-acc -ta=tesla:cc60'
            }
            self.sanity_patterns = sn.assert_found(
                r'time for single matrix vector multiplication', self.stdout)
            self.maintainers = ['you-can-type-your-email-here']
            self.tags = {'tutorial'}

        def compile(self):
            prgenv_flags = self.prgenv_flags[self.current_environ.name]
            self.current_environ.cflags = prgenv_flags
            super().compile()


    def _get_checks(**kwargs):
        return [OpenACCTest(**kwargs)]

The things to notice in this test are the restricted list of system partitions and programming environments that this test supports and the use of the ``modules`` variable:

.. code:: python

            self.modules = ['craype-accel-nvidia60']

The ``modules`` variable takes a list of modules that should be loaded during the setup phase of the test. In this particular test, we need to load the ``craype-accel-nvidia60`` module, which enables the generation of a GPU binary from an OpenACC code.

It is also important to note that in GPU-enabled tests the number of GPUs for each node have to be specified by setting the corresponding variable ``num_gpus_per_node``, as follows:

.. code:: python

    self.num_gpus_per_node = 1

The regression test for the CUDA code is slightly simpler:

.. code:: python

    import os
    import reframe.utility.sanity as sn

    from reframe.core.pipeline import RegressionTest


    class CudaTest(RegressionTest):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__('example5_check',
                             os.path.dirname(__file__), **kwargs)
            self.descr = 'Matrix-vector multiplication example with CUDA'
            self.valid_systems = ['daint:gpu']
            self.valid_prog_environs = ['PrgEnv-cray', 'PrgEnv-gnu', 'PrgEnv-pgi']
            self.sourcepath = 'example_matrix_vector_multiplication_cuda.cu'
            self.executable_opts = ['1024', '100']
            self.modules = ['cudatoolkit']
            self.num_gpus_per_node = 1
            self.sanity_patterns = sn.assert_found(
                r'time for single matrix vector multiplication', self.stdout)
            self.maintainers = ['you-can-type-your-email-here']
            self.tags = {'tutorial'}


    def _get_checks(**kwargs):
        return [CudaTest(**kwargs)]

ReFrame will recognize the ``.cu`` extension of the source file and it will try to invoke ``nvcc`` for compiling the code. In this case, there is no need to differentiate across the programming environments, since the compiler will be eventually the same. ``nvcc`` in our example is provided by the ``cudatoolkit`` module, which we list it in the ``modules`` variable.

More Advanced Sanity Checking
-----------------------------

So far we have done a very simple sanity checking. We are only looking if a specific line is present in the output of the test program. In this example, we expand the regression test of the serial code, so as to check also if the printed norm of the result matrix is correct.

.. code:: python

    import os
    import reframe.utility.sanity as sn

    from reframe.core.pipeline import RegressionTest


    class SerialNormTest(RegressionTest):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__('example6_check',
                             os.path.dirname(__file__), **kwargs)
            self.descr = 'Matrix-vector multiplication with L2 norm check'
            self.valid_systems = ['*']
            self.valid_prog_environs = ['*']
            self.sourcepath = 'example_matrix_vector_multiplication.c'

            matrix_dim = 1024
            iterations = 100
            self.executable_opts = [str(matrix_dim), str(iterations)]

            expected_norm = matrix_dim
            found_norm = sn.extractsingle(
                r'The L2 norm of the resulting vector is:\s+(?P<norm>\S+)',
                self.stdout, 'norm', float)
            self.sanity_patterns = sn.all([
                sn.assert_found(
                    r'time for single matrix vector multiplication', self.stdout),
                sn.assert_lt(sn.abs(expected_norm - found_norm), 1.0e-6)
            ])
            self.maintainers = ['you-can-type-your-email-here']
            self.tags = {'tutorial'}


    def _get_checks(**kwargs):
        return [SerialNormTest(**kwargs)]

The only difference with our first example is actually the more complex expression to assess the sanity of the test. Let's go over it line-by-line. The first thing we do is to extract the norm printed in the standard output.

.. code:: python

            found_norm = sn.extractsingle(
                r'The L2 norm of the resulting vector is:\s+(?P<norm>\S+)',
                self.stdout, 'norm', float)

The ``extractsingle()`` sanity function extracts some information from a single occurrence (by default the first) of a pattern in a filename. In our case, this function will extract the ``norm`` `group <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__ from the match of the regular expression ``r'The L2 norm of the resulting vector is:\s+(?P<norm>\S+)'`` in standard output, it will convert it to float and it will return it. Unnamed groups in regular expressions are also supported, which you can reference them by their group number. For example, we could have written the same statement as follows:

.. code:: python

            found_norm = sn.extractsingle(
                r'The L2 norm of the resulting vector is:\s+(\S+)',
                self.stdout, 1, float)

Notice that we replaced the ``'norm'`` argument with ``1``, which is the group number.

    NOTE: In regular expressions, group ``0`` is always the whole match. In sanity functions dealing with regular expressions, this will yield the whole line that matched.

A useful counterpart of ``extractsingle()`` is the ``extractall()`` function, which instead of a single occurrence, returns a list of all the occurrences found. For a more detailed description of this and other sanity functions, please refer to the `sanity function reference <sanity_functions_reference.html>`__.

The next couple of lines is the actual sanity check:

.. code:: python

            self.sanity_patterns = sn.all([
                sn.assert_found(
                    r'time for single matrix vector multiplication', self.stdout),
                sn.assert_lt(sn.abs(expected_norm - found_norm), 1.0e-6)
            ])

This expression combines two conditions that need to true, in order for the sanity check to succeed:

1. Find in standard output the same line we were looking for already in the first example.
2. Verify that the printed norm does not deviate significantly from the expected value.

The ``reframe.utility.sanity.all()`` function is responsible for combining the results of the individual subexpressions. It is essentially the Python built-in `all() <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#all>`__ function, exposed as a sanity function, and requires that all the elements of the iterable it takes as an argument evaluate to ``True``. As mentioned before, all the ``assert_*`` functions either return ``True`` on success or raise ``reframe.core.exceptions.SanityError``. So, if everything goes smoothly, ``sn.all()`` will evaluate to ``True`` and sanity checking will succeed.

The expression for the second condition is more interesting. Here, we want to assert that the absolute value of the difference between the expected and the found norm are below a certain value. The important thing to mention here is that you can combine the results of sanity functions in arbitrary expressions, use them as arguments to other functions, return them from functions, assign them to variables etc. Remember that sanity functions are not evaluated at the time you call them. They will be evaluated later by the framework during the sanity checking phase. If you include the result of a sanity function in an expression, the evaluation of the resulting expression will also be deferred. For a detailed description of the mechanism behind the sanity functions, please have a look at `"Understanding The Mechanism Of Sanity Functions" <deferrables.html>`__ section.

Writing a Performance Test
--------------------------

An important aspect of regression testing is checking for performance regressions. ReFrame offers a flexible way of extracting and manipulating performance data from the program output, as well as a comprehensive way of setting performance thresholds per system and system partitions.

In this example, we extend the CUDA test presented `previously <tutorial.html#testing-a-gpu-code>`__, so as to check also the performance of the matrix-vector multiplication.

.. code:: python

    import os
    import reframe.utility.sanity as sn

    from reframe.core.pipeline import RegressionTest


    class CudaPerfTest(RegressionTest):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__('example7_check',
                             os.path.dirname(__file__), **kwargs)
            self.descr = 'Matrix-vector multiplication (CUDA performance test)'
            self.valid_systems = ['daint:gpu']
            self.valid_prog_environs = ['PrgEnv-gnu', 'PrgEnv-cray', 'PrgEnv-pgi']
            self.sourcepath = 'example_matrix_vector_multiplication_cuda.cu'
            self.executable_opts = ['4096', '1000']
            self.modules = ['cudatoolkit']
            self.num_gpus_per_node = 1
            self.sanity_patterns = sn.assert_found(
                r'time for single matrix vector multiplication', self.stdout)
            self.perf_patterns = {
                'perf': sn.extractsingle(r'Performance:\s+(?P<Gflops>\S+) Gflop/s',
                                         self.stdout, 'Gflops', float)
            }
            self.reference = {
                'daint:gpu': {
                    'perf': (50.0, -0.1, 0.1),
                }
            }
            self.maintainers = ['you-can-type-your-email-here']
            self.tags = {'tutorial'}

        def compile(self):
            self.current_environ.cxxflags = '-O3'
            super().compile()


    def _get_checks(**kwargs):
        return [CudaPerfTest(**kwargs)]

The are two new variables set in this test that basically enable the performance testing:

``perf_patterns``
    This variable defines which are the performance patterns we are looking for and how to extract the performance values.
``reference``
    This variable is a collection of reference values for different systems.

Let's have a closer look at each of them:

.. code:: python

            self.perf_patterns = {
                'perf': sn.extractsingle(r'Performance:\s+(?P<Gflops>\S+) Gflop/s',
                                         self.stdout, 'Gflops', float)
            }

The ``perf_patterns`` attribute is a dictionary, whose keys are *performance variables* (i.e., arbitrary names assigned to the performance values we are looking for), and its values are *sanity expressions* that specify how to obtain these performance values from the output. A sanity expression is a Python expression that uses the result of one or more *sanity functions*. In our example, we name the performance value we are looking for simply as ``perf`` and we extract its value by converting to float the regex group named ``Gflops`` from the line that was matched in the standard output.

Each of the performance variables defined in ``perf_patterns`` must be resolved in the ``reference`` dictionary of reference values. When the framework obtains a performance value from the output of the test it searches for a reference value in the ``reference`` dictionary, and then it checks whether the user supplied tolerance is respected. Let's go over the ``reference`` dictionary of our example and explain its syntax in more detail:

.. code:: python

            self.reference = {
                'daint:gpu': {
                    'perf': (50.0, -0.1, 0.1),
                }
            }

This is a special type of dictionary that we call ``scoped dictionary``, because it defines scopes for its keys. We have already seen it being used in the ``environments`` section of the `configuration file <configure.html#environments-configuration>`__ of ReFrame. In order to resolve a reference value for a performance variable, ReFrame creates the following key ``<current_sys>:<current_part>:<perf_variable>`` and looks it up inside the ``reference`` dictionary. If our example, since this test is only allowed to run on the ``daint:gpu`` partition of our system, ReFrame will look for the ``daint:gpu:perf`` reference key. The ``perf`` subkey will then be searched in the following scopes in this order: ``daint:gpu``, ``daint``, ``*``. The first occurrence will be used as the reference value of the ``perf`` performance variable. In our example, the ``perf`` key will be resolved in the ``daint:gpu`` scope giving us the reference value.

Reference values in ReFrame are specified as a three-tuple comprising the reference value and lower and upper thresholds. Thresholds are specified as decimal fractions of the reference value. The lower threshold must lie in the [-1,0] interval, whereas the upper threshold must be lie in the [0,1] interval. In our example, the reference value for this test on ``daint:gpu`` is 50 Gflop/s ±10%. Setting a threshold value to ``None`` disables the threshold.

Combining It All Together
-------------------------

As we have mentioned before and as you have already experienced with the examples in this tutorial, regression tests in ReFrame are written in pure Python. As a result, you can leverage the language features and capabilities to organize better your tests and decrease the maintenance cost. In this example, we are going to reimplement all the tests of the tutorial with much less code and in a single file. Here is the final example code that combines all the tests discussed before:

.. code:: python

    import os
    import reframe.utility.sanity as sn

    from reframe.core.pipeline import RegressionTest


    class BaseMatrixVectorTest(RegressionTest):
        def __init__(self, test_version, **kwargs):
            super().__init__('example8_' + test_version.lower() + '_check',
                             os.path.dirname(__file__), **kwargs)
            self.descr = '%s matrix-vector multiplication' % test_version
            self.valid_systems = ['*']
            self.valid_prog_environs = ['*']
            self.prgenv_flags = None

            matrix_dim = 1024
            iterations = 100
            self.executable_opts = [str(matrix_dim), str(iterations)]

            expected_norm = matrix_dim
            found_norm = sn.extractsingle(
                r'The L2 norm of the resulting vector is:\s+(?P<norm>\S+)',
                self.stdout, 'norm', float)
            self.sanity_patterns = sn.all([
                sn.assert_found(
                    r'time for single matrix vector multiplication', self.stdout),
                sn.assert_lt(sn.abs(expected_norm - found_norm), 1.0e-6)
            ])
            self.maintainers = ['you-can-type-your-email-here']
            self.tags = {'tutorial'}


        def compile(self):
            if self.prgenv_flags is not None:
                self.current_environ.cflags = self.prgenv_flags[self.current_environ.name]

            super().compile()


    class SerialTest(BaseMatrixVectorTest):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__('Serial', **kwargs)
            self.sourcepath = 'example_matrix_vector_multiplication.c'


    class OpenMPTest(BaseMatrixVectorTest):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):

This test abstracts away the common functionality found in almost all of our tutorial tests (executable options, sanity checking, etc.) to a base class, from which all the concrete regression tests derive. Each test then redefines only the parts that are specific to it. The ``_get_checks()`` now instantiates all the insteresting tests and returns them as a list to the framework. The total line count of this refactored example is less than half of that of the individual tutorial tests. Notice how the base class for all tutorial regression tests specify additional parameters to its constructor, so that the concrete subclasses can initialize it based on their needs.

Another interesting technique, not demonstrated here, is to create regression test factories that will create different regression tests based on specific arguments they take in their constructor.

We use such techniques extensively in the regression tests for our production systems, in order to facilitate their maintenance.

Summary
-------

This concludes our ReFrame tutorial. We have covered all basic aspects of writing regression tests in ReFrame and you should now be able to start experimenting by writing your first useful tests. The `next section <advanced.html>`__ covers further topics in customizing a regression test to your needs.
