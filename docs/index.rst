==================
Welcome to ReFrame
==================

ReFrame is a high-level framework for writing regression tests for HPC systems.
The goal of the framework is to abstract away the complexity of the interactions with the system, separating the logic of a regression test from the low-level details, which pertain to the system configuration and setup.
This allows users to write easily portable regression tests, focusing only on the functionality.

Regression tests in ReFrame are simple Python classes that specify the basic parameters of the test.
The framework will load the test and will send it down a well-defined pipeline that will take care of its execution.
The stages of this pipeline take care of all the system interaction details, such as programming environment switching, compilation, job submission, job status query, sanity checking and performance assessment.

ReFrame also offers a high-level and flexible abstraction for writing sanity and performance checks for your regression tests, without having to care about the details of parsing output files, searching for patterns and testing against reference values for different systems.

Writing system regression tests in a high-level modern programming language, like Python, poses a great advantage in organizing and maintaining the tests.
Users can create their own test hierarchies or test factories for generating multiple tests at the same time and they can also customize them in a simple and expressive way.

Finally, ReFrame offers a powerful and efficient runtime for running and managing the execution of tests, as well as integration with common logging facilities, where ReFrame can send live data from currently running performance tests.


Use Cases
=========

A pre-release of ReFrame has been in production at the `Swiss National Supercomputing Centre <http://www.cscs.ch>`__ since early December 2016.
The `first <https://github.com/eth-cscs/reframe/releases/tag/v2.2>`__ public release was in May 2017 and it is being actively developed since then.
Several HPC centers around the globe have adopted ReFrame for testing and benchmarking their systems in an easy, consistent and reproducible way.
You can read a couple of use cases `here <usecases.html>`__.
