Test API Reference
==================

This page provides a reference guide of the ReFrame API for writing regression tests covering all the relevant details.
Internal data structures and APIs are covered only to the extent that this might be helpful to the final user of the framework.

Builtins
--------

.. versionadded:: 3.4.2

ReFrame test base classes and, in particular, the :class:`reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin` class, define a set of functions and decorators that can be used to define essential test elements, such as variables, parameters, fixtures, pipeline hooks etc.
These are called *builtins* because they are directly available for use inside the test class body that is being defined without the need to import any module.
However, almost all of these builtins are also available from the :obj:`reframe.core.builtins` module.
The use of this module is required only when creating new tests programmatically using the :func:`~reframe.core.meta.make_test` function.

.. versionchanged:: 3.7.0
   Expose :func:`@deferrable <reframe.core.builtins.deferrable>` as a builtin.

.. versionchanged:: 3.11.0
   Builtins are now available also through the :obj:`reframe.core.builtins` module.


.. py:method:: reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.bind(func, name=None)

   Bind a free function to a regression test.

   By default, the function is bound with the same name as the free function.
   However, the function can be bound using a different name with the ``name`` argument.

   :param func: external function to be bound to a class.
   :param name: bind the function under a different name.

   .. note::
      This is the only builtin that is not available through the :obj:`reframe.core.builtins` module.
      The reason is that the :func:`bind` method needs to access the class namespace directly in order to bind the free function to the class.

.. _pipeline-hooks:

--------------
Pipeline Hooks
--------------

ReFrame provides a mechanism to allow attaching arbitrary functions to run before or after a given stage of the execution pipeline.
This is achieved through the :func:`@run_before <reframe.core.builtins.run_before>` and :func:`@run_after <reframe.core.builtins.run_after>` test builtins.
Once attached to a given stage, these functions are referred to as *pipeline hooks*.
A hook may be attached to multiple pipeline stages and multiple hooks may also be attached to the same pipeline stage.
Pipeline hooks attached to multiple stages will be executed on each pipeline stage the hook was attached to.
Pipeline stages with multiple hooks attached will execute these hooks in the order in which they were attached to the given pipeline stage.
A derived class will inherit all the pipeline hooks defined in its bases, except for those whose hook function is overridden by the derived class.
A function that overrides a pipeline hook from any of the base classes will not be a pipeline hook unless the overriding function is explicitly reattached to any pipeline stage.
In the event of a name clash arising from multiple inheritance, the inherited pipeline hook will be chosen following Python's `MRO <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#class.__mro__>`__.

A function may be attached to any of the following stages (listed in order of execution): ``init``, ``setup``, ``compile``, ``run``, ``sanity``, ``performance`` and ``cleanup``.
The ``init`` stage refers to the test's instantiation and it runs before entering the execution pipeline.
Therefore, a test function cannot be attached to run before the ``init`` stage.
Hooks attached to any other stage will run exactly before or after this stage executes.
So although a "post-init" and a "pre-setup" hook will both run *after* a test has been initialized and *before* the test goes through the first pipeline stage, they will execute in different times:
the post-init hook will execute *right after* the test is initialized.
The framework will then continue with other activities and it will execute the pre-setup hook *just before* it schedules the test for executing its setup stage.

Pipeline hooks are normally executed in reverse MRO order, i.e., the hooks of the least specialized class will be executed first.
In the following example, :func:`BaseTest.x` will execute before :func:`DerivedTest.y`:

.. code-block:: python

   class BaseTest(rfm.RegressionTest):
       @run_after('setup')
       def x(self):
           '''Hook x'''

   class DerivedTest(BaseTeset):
       @run_after('setup')
       def y(self):
           '''Hook y'''


This order can be altered using the ``always_last`` argument of the :func:`@run_before <reframe.core.builtins.run_before>` and :func:`@run_after <reframe.core.builtins.run_after>` decorators.
In this case, all hooks of the same stage defined with ``always_last=True`` will be executed in MRO order at the end of the stage's hook chain.
For example, given the following hierarchy:

 .. code-block:: python

    class X(rfm.RunOnlyRegressionTest):
        @run_before('run', always_last=True)
        def hook_a(self): pass

        @run_before('run')
        def hook_b(self): pass

    class Y(X):
        @run_before('run', always_last=True)
        def hook_c(self): pass

        @run_before('run')
        def hook_d(self): pass


the run hooks of :class:`Y` will be executed as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   X.hook_b, Y.hook_d, Y.hook_c, X.hook_a


.. seealso::
   - :func:`@run_before <reframe.core.builtins.run_before>`, :func:`@run_after <reframe.core.builtins.run_after>` decorators

.. note::

   Pipeline hook functions cannot be private, i.e., starting with double underscore: ``__``.

.. note::
   Pipeline hooks do not execute in the test's stage directory, but in the directory that ReFrame executes in.
   However, the test's :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.stagedir` can be accessed by explicitly changing the working directory from within the hook function itself (see the :class:`~reframe.utility.osext.change_dir` utility for further details):

   .. code:: python

     import reframe.utility.osext as osext

     class MyTest(rfm.RegressionTest):
         ...
         @run_after('run')
         def my_post_run_hook(self):
             # Access the stage directory
             with osext.change_dir(self.stagedir):
                 ...

.. note::
   In versions prior to 4.3.4, overriding a pipeline hook in a subclass would re-attach it from scratch in the stage, therefore changing its execution order relative to other hooks of the superclass.
   This is fixed in versions >= 4.3.4 where the execution order of the hook is not changed.
   However, the fix may break existing workaround code that used to call explicitly the base class' hook from the derived one.
   Check issue `#3012 <https://github.com/reframe-hpc/reframe/issues/3012>`__ for details on how to properly address this.

.. warning::
   .. versionchanged:: 3.7.0
      Declaring pipeline hooks using the same name functions from the :py:mod:`reframe` or :py:mod:`reframe.core.decorators` modules is now deprecated.
      You should use the builtin functions described in the :ref:`builtins` section..

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0.0
      Pipeline hooks can only be defined through the built-in functions described in this section.

.. warning::
   .. versionchanged:: 3.9.2

      Execution of pipeline hooks until this version was implementation-defined.
      In practice, hooks of a derived class were executed before those of its parents.

      This version defines the execution order of hooks, which now follows a strict reverse MRO order, so that parent hooks will execute before those of derived classes.
      Tests that relied on the execution order of hooks might break with this change.

.. tip::

   When writing library tests or :class:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin`'s that are meant to be re-used by multiple final tests, it is a good practice to define their hooks using a unique name scheme, e.g., ``_<ClassName>_<hook_name>``.
   This will avoid possible clashes with hooks in derived test classes that may use the same hook name hiding inadvertently the base class hook.
   Note that in future ReFrame may create unique names for pipeline hooks automatically.


.. _test-variants:

-------------
Test variants
-------------

Through the :func:`~reframe.core.builtins.parameter` and :func:`~reframe.core.builtins.fixture` builtins, a regression test may store multiple versions or `variants` of a regression test at the class level.
During class creation, the test's parameter and fixture spaces are constructed and combined, assigning a unique index to each of the available test variants.
In most cases, the user does not need to be aware of all the internals related to this variant indexing, since ReFrame will run by default all the available variants for each of the registered tests.
On the other hand, in more complex use cases such as setting dependencies across different test variants, or when performing some complex variant sub-selection on a fixture declaration, the user may need to access some of this low-level information related to the variant indexing.
Therefore, classes that derive from the base :class:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin` provide `classmethods` and properties to query these data.

.. warning::
  When selecting test variants through their variant index, no index ordering should ever be assumed, being the user's responsibility to ensure on each ReFrame run that the selected index corresponds to the desired parameter and/or fixture variants.

.. py:attribute:: RegressionMixin.num_variants

   Total number of variants of the test.

-------------
Build Systems
-------------

.. versionadded:: 2.14

ReFrame delegates the compilation of the regression test to a `build system`.
Build systems in ReFrame are entities that are responsible for generating the necessary shell commands for compiling a code.
Each build system defines a set of attributes that users may set in order to customize their compilation.
An example usage is the following:

.. code:: python

  self.build_system = 'SingleSource'
  self.build_system.cflags = ['-fopenmp']

Users simply set the build system to use in their regression tests and then they configure it.
If no special configuration is needed for the compilation, users may completely ignore the build systems.
ReFrame will automatically pick one based on the regression test attributes and will try to compile the code.

All build systems in ReFrame derive from the abstract base class :class:`reframe.core.buildsystems.BuildSystem`.
This class defines a set of common attributes, such us compilers, compilation flags etc. that all subclasses inherit.
It is up to the concrete build system implementations on how to use or not these attributes.
